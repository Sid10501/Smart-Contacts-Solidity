# Smart-Contacts-Solidity
This is a Web3 application made using Solidity.

On this react app, anyone on the internet can send me a ðŸ‘‹ + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract. In return the connected ETH wallet will receive 0.001 RinkebyETH! I'll be adding more features to this soon!
